# BCA_SEM2
A  collection of programs we did in the 2nd Sem while stuck at home in Quarantine :joy: yeah 2020 it is.

## I forked this repo what to do now?
So you are done with getting used to GitHub and want to **contribute** for real now. But where to begin? Well that's where I come in.

I will assgin tasks *below* and you have to finish them.

- Quick Recap
  - Add you name to [Contributors.md](Contributors.md)
- Classify the program types
  - Inspect the .c files
  - Determine what type it is (Like **Basic** (*Sub divide* into Calculatons, Conditional, Loop, Menu Driven), **Pointers**,Structure, Data Structures(Sub divide into Stacks, Queues, LinkLists, Trees,etc)
  - If you can't determine the type make a directory named **Others** and move them to here 
  - Remember to leave a copy of the .sh file in each directory (Only the ones with atleast one .c file. Not the ones with sub-directories only)
  - You are free to use either the web interface of [GitHub](https://github.com) or the CLI interface from your Linux shell
 - Your *commit message* **must** be in this format : _"**Relocated <filename>.c to /path/to/<filename.c>**"_

- You must **initiate atleast one program of yours**, (written from scartch or before, just _**No Copying Please**_ (Please mark as *incomplete* or *bugged* in *Commit message* if you can't finish it or it has errors) on your own **every 3 days**. _**It may or may not have existed in this repo before.**_
  - You are allowed to upload code you have written **yourself** before. (*Please keep it in accordance of SEM1 and SEM2*)
- You can improve or add features to existing finished programs. (Please mention that in commit message if the changes are appropiate they will be merged to the upstream
- <*More Tasks Coming Soon*>

## Note (For Contributors only others follow the forking approach)
Please create your **respective branches**(name them with your username unless it's a real mumbo jumbo to spell)
Make changes there and **create pull requests regularly**.
The above **rule of initiating new files apply to you as well** you just doing it on the **main repo in a different branch instead on your forked repo**
Make sure to **create pull request of your branch to your forked repo** to keep it updated.(Contact us to if you get confused)
It's **not necessary to inform** us every time you create a pull request **but** please do so for the 1st few weeks.

**This is solely for your practice of both coding and using GitHub**
